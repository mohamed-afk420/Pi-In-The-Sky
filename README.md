# Pi-In-The-Sky planning

We're going to be making a rocket/water rocket for our PI IN THE SKY project.


## Scope.  Is your project appropriately ambitious? 
I think our project is ambitious because I've never seen anyone try to put accelerometers and all those other things inside of a water bottle before, of course it's going to be a challenge try to keep all the things in there and to make sure it's not too heavy but we'll figure it out. 
## Diagrams of your planned design (CAD or hand sketched)

At first we were planning on going on onshape and building a water bottle out of CAD but we've decided to use a real water bottle and just add the wires and stuff in there, Hopefully this plan will work.
## Bill of materials for the overall project
 Smart water bottle  and Circuit board. 
## Risk Mitigation
One big risk is the project being too heavy or just not working. Again, I've never seen an engineering project in which a water bottle is being used so I don't know how this is going to work out for sure. We have to fit the curcuit board in the water bottle but I don't think that's going to a problem with weight, I think it's just going to take up a lot of space and other parts might be crowded inside of the rocket.

## Develop an initial design (pencil and paper, CAD, etc.)

## Construct a prototype
## Test your design
## Refine/optimize your design
## Present finished product
