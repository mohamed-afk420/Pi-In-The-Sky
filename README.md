Something like this is what we're going to build, at first we were planning on going on onshape and building a water bottle out of CAD but we've decided to use a real water bottle and just add the wires and stuff in there.
## Plan
Next class period we'll lay out a schedule and a plan to to by, right now we don't have a schedule to manage ourselves.
