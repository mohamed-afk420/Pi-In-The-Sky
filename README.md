At first we were planning on going on onshape and building a water bottle out of CAD but we've decided to use a real water bottle and just add the wires and stuff in there, Hopefully this plan will work.
## Plan
Next class period we'll lay out a schedule and a plan to to by, right now we don't have a schedule to manage ourselves.
